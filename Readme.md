# EnviroCar Track Visualizer with MapLibre (Challenge App)

* This Android application demonstrates visualizing a recorded enviroCar track on a MapLibre map, mimicking functionalities potentially found in the enviroCar app.
## Purpose:

* This app serves as a personal project to showcase the feasibility of using MapLibre as an alternative to Mapbox in an enviroCar-like scenario.
* It fulfills the requirements of a code challenge to demonstrate practical skills in:
* Consuming data from a simulated enviroCar API (actual API access not implemented).
* Utilizing the MapLibre library for Android development.
* Building a basic map visualization application.
## Features:
* Track Fetching (Simulated): Simulates fetching a recorded enviroCar track in JSON format using a placeholder API call. (Note: This doesn't involve actual enviroCar API interaction.)
* Map Display: Presents a MapLibre map in OpenStreetMap (OSM) style.
* Track Visualization: Visualizes the retrieved track data as a Polyline on the map.
* Markers: Highlights the track's origin and destination points with markers.
* Popups (Basic): Clicking on a track point marker displays a generic message (placeholder functionality).

## Technical Stack:
* Android Studio
* MapLibre Native library for Android
## Getting Started:
* Go to [Testing.md](https://github.com/AshishKothariii/EnviroCarChallengeApp/blob/main/Testing.md) for testing this app.

* For the Solution and Approach Details go to [Approach.md](https://github.com/AshishKothariii/EnviroCarChallengeApp/blob/main/Approach.md).
## Important Note:
* This project focuses on core functionalities and serves as a demonstration. It doesn't implement the full features of a map visualization application.

## Potential Enhancements:
* Integrate actual enviroCar API calls to fetch real track data.
* Develop a more comprehensive popup functionality that displays the timestamp of the clicked track point.
* Implement additional features like user location tracking, map controls, and customization options.
* By showcasing these functionalities, this project demonstrates the potential for migrating map functionalities from Mapbox to MapLibre in an enviroCar-like context.ionalities and serves as a demonstration. It doesn't implement the full features of a map visualization application.
