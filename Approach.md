# This document outlines the technical approach used in the EnviroCar Track Visualizer with MapLibre challenge app.

## Objective:

* Develop an Android application that visualizes a recorded enviroCar track on a MapLibre map.
## Approach:

### Data Fetching (Simulated):

* Utilize a placeholder API call to simulate fetching a pre-defined JSON string representing a recorded enviroCar track.
* This JSON data would typically contain GPS coordinates and timestamps in a real-world scenario.
* Parse the JSON data to extract relevant information like latitude, longitude, and timestamps (if applicable).
### Map Integration:

* Leverage the MapLibre Native library for Android to display a map.
* Set the map style to OpenStreetMap (OSM) to provide a familiar base map.
### Track Visualization:

* Utilize the MapLibre API to create a Polyline object from the extracted list of GPS coordinates.
* Add the Polyline object to the map, effectively visualizing the track path.
## Markers:

* Create markers for the origin and destination points of the track using the MapLibre API.
* Customize marker icons (optional) to visually distinguish them.
## Popups (Basic):
* Implement a basic on-click listener for the track point markers.
* When a marker is clicked, display a simple message (placeholder functionality).
## Technical Considerations:

* This approach prioritizes simplicity and demonstration of core functionalities.
* In a real-world scenario, the app would need to:
* Implement actual enviroCar API calls for secure and authenticated data retrieval.
* Handle potential errors or network issues during the data fetching process.
## Further Enhancements:

Integrate the actual enviroCar API for track data retrieval.
* Develop a more comprehensive popup functionality that displays the timestamp of the clicked track point.
* Implement user location tracking and display it on the map (with appropriate permissions).
* Add map controls (zoom, pan) to enhance user interaction.
* Explore customization options for map styles and marker icons.
* By following this approach, the EnviroCar Track Visualizer demonstrates the feasibility of migrating map functionalities from Mapbox to MapLibre while showcasing core visualization capabilities.
